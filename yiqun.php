	<h2> Life Background</h2>
	<p> 
	Hi everyone! My Chinese name is Yiqun Ding but I go by Juliet. I am from Shanghai, China; however, this is already my sixth year in States. I went to a private high school called Salem Academy in North Carolina. The school was in a really small city called Winston-Salem, where Wake Forest University is, so I decided to go to a larger city where there are more resources and I can do more things. I am currently a sophomore at University of Rochester. I am trying to double major in Digital Media Studies and Psychology. </p>
	<h2>School Life</h2>
	<p> 
	My original plan was to double major in Psychology and International Relation, so I took many of these major courses during my freshman year. However, after a year, I came to realize that International Relation is not something that I am truly interested in. Then, I started looking into other majors, and eventually picked Digital Media Studies because it covers many different fields and is related to communication, which I am considering as my job path in the future. Although there are many major classes I need to take, I am still trying to maximize what I can learn in college; I took a variety of courses such as dance, stage design, French, python, etc. 
 </p>
 	<h2>Internship Experience</h2>
 	<p> 
	Due to a special internship program in my high school, I’ve interned at two different companies during my high school time —- South China Morning Post and VMware. However, since I was still young and did not to too much in either of the field, my internship wasn’t as meaningful as my other experience later in college. Freshman year summer in college, I worked as an HR intern in IKEA, and I have loved the time working with the company and the co-workers. I like the working environment/company’s culture of IKEA; how everyone treated me like an actual employee to ask me do things; and how much I learned about work, new skills, and even new people that summer. 
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p> 
	During my spare time, I like to watch movies, listen to music, hangout with friends, travel, and read. I am not the kind of person that can be in one space for a long time. I have travelled to around 15 countries so far. I like to go out, to explore, and to try new things. Therefore, there is not a certain kind of music of movies that I call as favorite; I am always open to new things and new challenges.
